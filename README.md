# FAQ

In `tools/test`, we include a small LSBench dataset and sample queries for testing purpose. 
The large dataset we use in our paper can be found at Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11pyMlnUkghGbiFlE1HuHUVgMIUqf52Ml?usp=sharing). The related config file is `tools/test/config_large`
